# Proof-of-Stake

Celo uses a Proof of Stake mechanism for selecting the validator set. Anyone can earn rewards by bonding Celo Gold and by participating in validator elections and governance proposals. In addition, those interested in helping run the network can run a validator. Initially, the number of validators will be capped to one hundred nodes elected by Celo Gold holders but that number is expected to grow over time. Validators earn additional fixed rewards in Celo Dollars to cover their costs plus margin.
