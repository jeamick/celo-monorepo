# Consensus

Celo’s consensus protocol is based on an implementation called Istanbul, or IBFT. IBFT was developed by AMIS and [proposed](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fethereum%2FEIPs%2Fissues%2F650) as an extension to [go-ethereum](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fethereum%2Fgo-ethereum) but never merged. Variants of IBFT exist in both the [Quorum](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjpmorganchase%2Fquorum) and [Pantheon](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPegaSysEng%2Fpantheon) clients. We’ve modified Istanbul to bring it up to date with the latest [go-ethereum](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fethereum%2Fgo-ethereum) releases and we’re fixing [correctness and liveness issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07160) and improving its scalability and security.

Celo’s consensus protocol is performed by nodes that are selected as validators. There is a maximum cap on the number of active validators that can be changed by governance proposal, which is currently set at a 100 validators. The active validator set is determined via the Proof-of-Stake process and is updated at the end of each epoch, a fixed period of approximately one day.
